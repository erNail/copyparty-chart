# copyparty-chart

A lightweight Helm chart for [copyparty](https://github.com/9001/copyparty) that prioritizes
transparency and flexibility.

Linted with [`kube-score`](https://github.com/zegl/kube-score),
[`kube-linter`](https://github.com/stackrox/kube-linter)
and [`yamllint`](https://github.com/stackrox/kube-linter).
Tested with [`helm-unittest`](https://github.com/helm-unittest/helm-unittest).

## Design Philosophy

### Transparency and Flexibility over Abstraction and Convenience

This chart may diverge from some common chart conventions.
It favors transparency and flexibility over abstraction and convenience:

- **Values-Driven:** The goal is to provide a chart that can be understood just by looking at the values file.
  There should be no need to look into the templates to understand what the chart does and how it works.
- **Minimal Abstraction:** The chart avoids hidden logic and magic behavior as much as possible.
  A lot of what you see in the values file is what gets rendered in the templates.
- **Flexibility over Convenience:** The chart is designed to be flexible and understandable.
  But this comes at the cost of convenience.
  For example, if you want to use arguments instead of a config file mounted from a secret,
  you can do so via editing the values file. But you'd have to make edits in multiple places.
  You'd have to set `.Values.configMap.enabled` to `false`, add the arguments to `.Values.app.args`,
  and remove the ConfigMap volumes from `.Values.volumes` and `.Values.volumeMounts`.
